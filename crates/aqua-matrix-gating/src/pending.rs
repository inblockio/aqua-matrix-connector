//! The shared `ask_user` primitive — a pending-reply router that lets a run
//! pause and ask the authenticated user a question over the same Matrix
//! channel, then resolves on their next DM.
//!
//! This is the core capability reused by Phases A, B, and C of the
//! chat-confirmations plan; only *what triggers a question* and *what an answer
//! authorises* differ between phases. The router itself is phase-agnostic.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! The relay's [`MessageHandler::handle_message`] fires once per inbound DM
//! from `target`. Normally every DM starts a fresh `claude` run. While a run is
//! awaiting an answer we want the inverse: the user's *next* DM is the answer,
//! not a new prompt. [`PendingMap`] is the shared state that makes this work:
//!
//! - [`PendingMap::ask`] registers a one-shot keyed by `target`, sends the
//!   question, and awaits the answer with a timeout — **default-DENY** on
//!   timeout so a silent user can never wedge the `claude` process.
//! - [`PendingMap::try_resolve`] is called first thing in `handle_message`; if
//!   a question is pending for `target` it consumes the DM as the answer
//!   (returning `true`) instead of letting it start a new run.
//!
//! Exactly one question per `target` is open at a time (the relay already runs
//! ~one conversation per user, and [`PendingMap::ask`] overwrites/aborts any
//! stale entry), so there is no question/answer correlation ambiguity.
